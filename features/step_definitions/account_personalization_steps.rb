You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I have signed up for a new account$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I complete the sign up process, I am taken to a "(.*?)" page$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I can set the number of humans in my household$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^for each human I can select a size$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^for each human I can select dietary restrictions$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I can save my settings$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I have an account$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I sign in$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I can go to my "(.*?)" page$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I can change the number of humans in my household$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^for each human I can change the size$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^for each human I can change the dietary restrictions$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
